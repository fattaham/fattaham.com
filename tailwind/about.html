        <p>
          Hi I’m Fattah, was born in Bandung in 1999, and live in Bekasi. I love

          updated data and current literature to make better decision, in a
          world so changes so fast.
        </p>
        <p>
          I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Law, specializing in
          International Economic Law, where I focused on areas such as
          Copyright, Patents, and Intellectual Property. After graduation, I
          worked at Bank Rakyat Indonesia as a Bank Teller, and Customer Service
          Representative, gaining valuable experience in communication, customer
          relations, and problem-solving.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning knowledge into a professional world result, I value
          sustainable learning based on research and apply insight an a
          practical way. Building sustainable in a long-term growth always be my
          priorities to make a big changes, and guided by the principle of
          Kaizen 1% that is focusing on small and meaningful step in every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe, to focusing to every little thing in every step will be
          truly matter, and become a powerful create and transformative result.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alongside my legal and banking background, I am passionate about
          continuous learning and professional growth. I am currently developing
          skills in Web Development, UI/UX Design, and Digital Technology, with
          the ambition to combine my expertise in law and finance with modern
          digital innovations.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now fluent in Indonesian, English, German, and Sundanese, I bring
          strong cross-cultural communication skills. I am committed to
          improving my professional life and striving toward becoming a
          well-rounded professional who can adapt to global challenges and
          opportunities.
