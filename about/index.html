          Hi I’m Fattah, was born in Bandung in 1999, and live in Bekasi. I love

          world so changes so fast.

          priorities to make a big changes, and guided by the principle of
          Kaizen 1% that is focusing on small and meaningful step in every day.

          skills in Web Development, UI/UX Design, and Digital Technology, with
          the ambition to combine my expertise in law and finance with modern
          digital innovations.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now fluent in Indonesian, English, German, and Sundanese, I bring
          strong cross-cultural communication skills. I am committed to
          improving my professional life and striving toward becoming a
          well-rounded professional who can adapt to global challenges and
          opportunities.
