### Profile (Old)

Hello I'm Fattah a Software Engineer. I was born in Bandung, and right now I live in Bekasi. I love learning new things, including law, banking, languages, and modern field such as coding.

Where I spent my childhood and pursued my education from elementary school through university. I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Law, with a particular interest in Intellectual Property Law.

After graduating, I began my professional career at Bank Rakyat Indonesia, where I gained valuable experience in the banking sector. My background in law, especially intellectual property, sparked my curiosity about the digital world. This is why I now want to deepen my focus on web development and coding, exploring how technology and law can intersect in the future.
