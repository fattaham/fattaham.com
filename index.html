    <h1>Hello, I'm Fattah a Web Developer</h1>
    <p>
      I love learning new things, including law, banking, languages, and modern
      fields such as coding, UI/UX, and design. I'm also interested in the
      details of websites and apps. My goal is to grow and become more
      professional in everything I do.
